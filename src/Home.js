      Welcome to Original Scotland. I'm Pippa Bullock, an artist living and working amidst the magic of Scotland's West Coast and Hebrides.

For me, painting a landscape isn't about replicating a scene; it's about interpreting nature's voice and sharing that conversation with you through each piece I create.
